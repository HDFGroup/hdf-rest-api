The HDF REST API is an interface to HDF5 data stored on network-based architectures.
The HDF REST API has provisions to support CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations on
the full spectrum of HDF5 objects including: groups, links, datasets, attributes, and committed
data types. See https://support.hdfgroup.org/pubs/papers/RESTful_HDF5.pdf for more information on the
RESTful HDF5 interface.

As a REST-based API, implementations can be developed in a variety of languages, such as
JavaScript, Python, C, and other common languages. Some services which implement the HDF REST API are:
